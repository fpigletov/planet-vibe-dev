                        Bungee jumping is an action-filled recreational activity that involves head-first jumping from a tall structure with an elastic cord attached into participants' feet. That tall structure can be a building, crane, bridge or even a helicopter. The first modern bungee jump was in 1979 and since then the sport became widely popular. Bungee jumping is one of the most enjoyed extreme sports and available in almost every destination in the world.
