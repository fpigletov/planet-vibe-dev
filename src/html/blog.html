                        Grand Bassin (Ganga Talao). Sitting some 500 metres above sea level and set amongst the verdant mountainous southwest, the volcanic crater lake of Ganga Talao is one of the best places to visit in Mauritius both for the beautiful wild setting and to dig a little deeper into the islands predominant religion, Hinduism.                 Situated on the island's southwestern tip, the hypnotising magnificence of Le Morne Brabant is more than deserving of its UNESCO listed status. Just a brief boat ride from the mainland, the islet of Ile Aux Aigrettes is one of many isles and boat excursion tour options to consider. What makes this a must-visit place for wildlife enthusiasts in Mauritius is the focus on scientific research within the nature reserve.

                        Where to start with Dominica, wow! This country absolutely amazed me beyond any expectations. Coming into land on the tiny runway, I knew this was going to be a special trip, and I’m excited for your adventure to the nature island. Hopefully this Dominica travel guide will give you the insight you need to make the most out of your trip to this incredible island, one which now owns a little slice of my heart. A land where the mangos are delicious, the waters refreshing, and the honking of horns will make you smile as friendly faces exchange brief greetings through windows. Of course, the main draws when travelling to Dominica is nature itself. Hiking, water sports, and enjoying the slower pace of life form the basis of the perfect Dominica trip, but there are also other ways to keep your self entertained.

                        Recently I was writing a list of places my friend should visit in Spain, and as I read him out my proposed agenda, he scoffed at the idea of Mallorca. ‘Isn’t that just Magaluf, all about the booze and wild nights out?’ he asked, and I remembered that was exactly what I had expected when I boarded my flight to Mallorca a few years back. But the truth is, I barely did Mallorca justice because I went with that expectation myself. I was looking forward to a holiday, think crystal-clear waters, days by the beach, afternoons snacking on tapas and relaxing in the lush 5-star hotel in Mallorca I’d booked into. I even left my camera at home so I could completely switch off, with just a few changes of clothes and my iPhone in my pocket. What I found in Mallorca though was so much more than I had been expecting. If you are a Brit like me, then the reputation of Magaluf is something you will be well aware of; but in reality, Magaluf is such a tiny part of this island there is a whole host of history, culture and amazing nature to enjoy.

                        Cultural Hub of Ubud, Bali Ubud is full of vegan cafes, yoga retreats and lush green rice paddies. There are a million and one things to do in Bali, but if you want to slow down, a few days in cultural Ubud is a winner. Visit the famous water temples, enjoy traditional dance and explore the famous Monkey forest before taking in the lush green landscape. The Ijen sulphur mines are not only a dangerous workplace for underpaid staff but now a popular tourist attraction thanks to the ‘blue fire’ that is emitted from the lake at night.
